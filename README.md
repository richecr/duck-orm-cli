# [DuckORM](https://pypi.org/project/duck-orm/)

DuckORM CLI is a database migration tool for usage with the [DuckORM](https://github.com/richecr/duck-orm).

**Requirements**: Python 3.10+

**Duck-ORM is still under development**.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install duck-orm-cli
```

!!! note
    Don't forget to install `databases` before installing `duck-orm-cli`. 

## Quickstart

For this example we will create a connection to the SQLite database and create a model.

```bash
$ pip install databases[sqlite]
$ pip install ipython
```

Note that we want to use `ipython` here, because it supports using await expressions directly from the console.
